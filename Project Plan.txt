Overview:
    Text Of Terror v2 (Will find better name) will be a replica of 'Text Of Terror' game made by me previously.
    Version 2 will be 3d and open world, there will be the story line and side quests in a computer based scene.
    ToTv2 will pretty much be the recreation of ToT with a little more spice and depth.

Aspects:
    World
        Follow something easy and low polly, since that seems to be the type of game people are liking more now. But this does not have to be forever.
    Fighting
        Create sprites with AI combat intelegence for diffucility and randomness aspect.
        The attackers will have different abilities and in those even more abilities and difference in looks, fighting manner, etc.
        Attackers will have to be somehow created as physical forms of computer problems, 'bugs', 'viruses', etc.
        Make creation design sketches before making anything, see what looks good vs what does not.
    Levels
        Will make the storyline a heap longer and more interactive, this also includes making side quests, and optional things to do.
    Misc
        



This is my first ever game made that is not text based, this is going to be a challenge and I am doing this to gain knowledge in game design and making,
without doing the school course, this means that I can go at my own speed and also additionally I will publish this on steam if I think that it is good enough
to see if I can make any money or more credability from it. :)
